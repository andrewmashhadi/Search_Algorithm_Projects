# Search_Algorithm_Projects

The idea of the search_algorithm_gui project in this repository is to give a visual representation of what path finding algorithms 
like the breadth first search algorithm and Dijkstra's algorithm do when they are searching for paths between 
two points given specified (grid-like) nodes and edges.
