# Search_Algorithm_Projects

The idea of the project in this repository is to give a visual representation of what path finding algorithms 
like the breadth first search algorithm, depth first search algorithm, and Dijkstra's algorithm do when they are searching for paths between 
two points given specified (grid-like) nodes and edges.
